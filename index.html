        <p>A waterfall is a river or other body of water's steep fall over a rocky ledge into a plunge pool below.
            Waterfalls are also called cascades. The process of erosion, the wearing away of earth, plays an important
            part in the formation of waterfalls. Waterfalls themselves also contribute to erosion.</p>

        <h2>Section THREE</h2>
        <p>Most often, it seems to me, we find these things to be beautiful not because of something else they might
            bring us – a piece of furniture, say, or a ‘delicacy’ to be consumed – but because of the way that the forms
            of these things immediately strike us upon observation. In fact, one might even think that this experience
            of beauty is one of the bases for valuing nature – nature is valuable because it is beautiful.</p>
